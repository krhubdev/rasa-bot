        I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. Try a simple grounding exercise: slowly look around and name five things you can see,
        four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
        Breathe steadily as you do it to anchor your attention in the present.

  utter_anxiety/p0002:

        It’s normal to worry, and constant worrying can drain your energy. Set a five-minute timer,
        list the exact worries in a notebook, and beside each one write a next small step you can actually do.
        Close the notebook when the timer ends and switch to a short, calming activity.

  utter_anxiety/p0003:
    - text: |
        Pre-presentation nerves are common. Practice box breathing: 
        inhale 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4—repeat for one to two minutes. 
        Pair this with a quick run-through of your opening lines to build calm and momentum.

  utter_anxiety/p0004:
    - text: |
        That racing-heart feeling is a typical anxiety response. Plant your feet flat on the floor, 
        press your toes gently, and notice the pressure shifting from heels to toes for one minute. 
        Match that focus with slow exhales that are slightly longer than your inhales.

  utter_anxiety/p0005:
    - text: |
        When anxiety swells, a brief mindfulness check-in can help. Sit comfortably, 
        notice the sensation of air at the tip of your nose, and count ten natural breaths. 
        If your mind wanders, simply bring it back to breath without judgment.

  utter_anxiety/p0006:
    - text: |
        Tension without a clear cause can still be eased. Roll your shoulders back and down ten times, 
        gently stretch your neck side to side, and take a two-minute walk if possible. 
        Hydrate afterward to support your body’s reset.

  utter_anxiety/p0007:
    - text: |
        Test anxiety is common and manageable. Create a mini checklist of three topics to review, 
        spend focused 15-minute blocks on each, and take two-minute breathing breaks between blocks. 
        On exam day, do three rounds of slow box breathing before you begin.

  utter_anxiety/p0008:
    - text: |
        Catastrophic thoughts can snowball quickly. 
        Write the thought, then list evidence for and against it, 
        and finish with the most likely outcome in one sentence. 
        Keep the card and reread the balanced statement when the thought returns.

  utter_anxiety/p0009:
    - text: |
        Social anxiety can feel heavy. Prepare one or two simple openers in advance, 
        choose a small setting when possible, and give yourself a clear time limit for the event. 
        Afterward, note one thing that went okay to reinforce progress.

  utter_anxiety/p0010:
    - text: |
        Overthinking is exhausting. Schedule a daily ten-minute “worry window,” let your mind list concerns, then close it and shift to a brief absorbing task like a short walk or tidying a small space. Consistency trains your brain to postpone rumination.

  utter_anxiety/p0011:
    - text: |
        Worries about the future are common. Pick one small, doable goal for today, write the next two steps, and start the first step within five minutes. Small actions reduce uncertainty and rebuild a sense of control.

  utter_anxiety/p0012:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can show up in the body as nausea or lightheadedness. Sip water slowly, place a cool object against your palm, and practice gentle belly breathing: hand on stomach, inhale to lift your hand, exhale to lower it. Give yourself a calm five-minute window.

  utter_anxiety/p0013:
    - text: |
        When your mind derails, use a quick reset. Count backward from 10 to 1 with steady breaths, then describe one nearby object using color, shape, and texture. This brief focus helps your attention come back online.

  utter_anxiety/p0014:
    - text: |
        Nighttime worries like to get louder. Do a two-minute brain dump in a notebook, then try progressive muscle relaxation: starting at your toes, gently tense for five seconds and release, moving up through legs, torso, and face. Keep lights dim and screens away while you wind down.

  utter_anxiety/p0015:
    - text: |
        Feeling weighed down is understandable. Schedule one short pleasant activity—music, stretching, or a brief chat with a trusted friend—and give it a clear start and end time. Small doses of positive engagement help nudge mood upward.

  utter_anxiety/p0016:
    - text: |
        Chest tightness often accompanies anxiety. Practice a few rounds of box breathing (4-4-4-4) and gently place a hand on your chest to track slower exhales. Stand and roll your shoulders to release residual tension.

  utter_anxiety/p0017:
    - text: |
        Mental replays can be persistent. Write the situation in three sentences, add a compassionate note you would give a friend, and close with one learning you’re taking forward. Revisit this summary when the replay starts.

  utter_anxiety/p0018:
    - text: |
        Racing thoughts respond to a firm pause. Say “stop” in your mind, then shift to a one-minute focus on the feeling of air as you exhale. Follow it with a simple, concrete task like organizing three items on your desk.

  utter_anxiety/p0019:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can surface even during good times. Try a brief gratitude note with three specific items from today, then do a 1–2 minute grounding scan: feet on floor, seat on chair, breath in and out. This anchors attention in what’s here now.

  utter_anxiety/p0020:
    - text: |
        Fear of disappointing others can be heavy. Write your feelings in a private letter you won’t send, then identify one boundary or realistic expectation you can set this week. Keep the letter as a reminder that your needs also matter.

  utter_anxiety/p0021:
    - text: |
        Persistent anxiety can drain your energy. Try progressive muscle relaxation: tense each muscle group for five seconds, then release slowly from head to toe. Doing this for five minutes can signal safety to your nervous system.

  utter_anxiety/p0022:
    - text: |
        Shortness of breath is a common anxiety symptom. Use the 4-7-8 breathing method: inhale through your nose for 4, hold for 7, exhale through your mouth for 8. Repeat this cycle four times to stabilize your breath.

  utter_anxiety/p0023:
    - text: |
        Repetitive checking is a way of coping with uncertainty. Create a checklist, say out loud what you’ve already done, and then set the list aside. With practice, your mind learns to trust that the task is complete.

  utter_anxiety/p0024:
    - text: |
        Social anxiety is real and valid. Start by joining smaller gatherings, and bring along a supportive friend if you can. Gradual exposure builds confidence without overwhelming you.

  utter_anxiety/p0025:
    - text: |
        Physical “butterflies” in the stomach are common signs of anxiety. Close your eyes, picture a successful outcome, and replay it a few times. Visualization helps shift nervous energy into motivation.

  utter_anxiety/p0026:
    - text: |
        Fidgeting releases nervous energy. Channel it into something useful like squeezing a stress ball, stretching your arms, or taking a short walk. These actions let the body discharge tension safely.

  utter_anxiety/p0027:
    - text: |
        Anxiety often makes us self-conscious. Remind yourself gently that most people are focused on themselves, not on you. Practice self-kindness by affirming one thing you value about yourself today.

  utter_anxiety/p0028:
    - text: |
        Heart palpitations can feel alarming but are a natural anxiety response. Slow your breathing and place your hand gently on your chest while counting each beat. This steady focus helps your heart settle.

  utter_anxiety/p0029:
    - text: |
        A daily “worry time” can reduce intrusive thoughts. Schedule a fixed ten minutes to write down concerns, then deliberately move on to a pleasant activity. Training your brain this way reduces the urge to ruminate all day.

  utter_anxiety/p0030:
    - text: |
        Headaches are often linked with anxiety and tension. Take regular breaks from screens, sip water slowly, and do gentle neck stretches. Pair this with steady breathing to ease both body and mind.

  utter_anxiety/p0031:
    - text: |
        The fear of making mistakes is very common. Practice positive self-talk such as, “Mistakes help me learn.” Remind yourself that nobody performs perfectly all the time.

  utter_anxiety/p0032:
    - text: |
        Crowded places can feel overwhelming. Plan ahead by noting quiet spots where you can take a break and carry headphones or calming music. Knowing your escape plan reduces the sense of being trapped.

  utter_anxiety/p0033:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can affect appetite. Try mindful eating—notice flavors, textures, and pace yourself slowly. Keeping a simple food and mood journal may help you spot patterns and restore balance.

  utter_anxiety/p0034:
    - text: |
        Decision-making feels harder with anxiety. Limit your choices to two or three options, and remind yourself that most decisions aren’t permanent. This lightens the pressure and makes choices more manageable.

  utter_anxiety/p0035:
    - text: |
        Comparing yourself to others can fuel anxiety. Shift focus by listing three personal strengths or achievements from this week. Celebrating even small progress helps boost confidence.

  utter_anxiety/p0036:
    - text: |
        Anxiety often disrupts sleep. Establish a bedtime routine like journaling, light reading, or gentle stretches before bed. A consistent routine helps calm the mind and improve rest quality.

  utter_anxiety/p0037:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can weaken self-trust. Keep a journal of positive decisions you’ve made and reread it when doubt creeps in. Over time, you’ll see evidence that you can rely on yourself.

  utter_anxiety/p0038:
    - text: |
        Grounding techniques bring you back to the present. Hold a familiar object in your hand, notice its texture and weight, or name five things you can see around you. These simple actions reset focus.

  utter_anxiety/p0039:
    - text: |
        Negative “what if” thoughts can feel endless. Write down the thought, then challenge it with facts and real evidence. Replace it with a balanced statement to help break the cycle.

  utter_anxiety/p0040:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can cause nausea and stomach discomfort. Sip cool water, place your hand on your stomach, and breathe so your belly rises and falls gently. Pair this with a few slow exhales to ease the sensation.

  utter_anxiety/p0041:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can make starting tasks feel overwhelming. Break projects into smaller parts and celebrate each finished step, no matter how small. Progress builds momentum and reduces pressure.

  utter_anxiety/p0042:
    - text: |
        Over-apologizing often comes from anxiety. Remind yourself that mistakes are part of being human and that one apology is usually enough. Practice self-acceptance to reduce the urge to repeat apologies.

  utter_anxiety/p0043:
    - text: |
        Forgetfulness can increase during anxious moments. Keep a small notepad or use your phone for quick notes and reminders. This helps your mind relax, knowing the information is safe.

  utter_anxiety/p0044:
    - text: |
        Loud noises can trigger anxiety. Pause, take slow breaths, and picture yourself in a calm, safe place. If possible, use headphones or earplugs to reduce the impact of sound.

  utter_anxiety/p0045:
    - text: |
        Ongoing tension adds to anxiety. Schedule short breaks throughout the day for gentle stretches or mindful breathing. Even five minutes can help reset your body and mind.

  utter_anxiety/p0046:
    - text: |
        Shaking is a natural response to anxiety. Sit down if you can, steady your breathing, and focus on lengthening each exhale. Your body often calms as your breath slows.

  utter_anxiety/p0047:
    - text: |
        Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Support systems exist to guide you, and everyone needs help at times. Accepting support lightens the weight of anxiety.

  utter_anxiety/p0048:
    - text: |
        Social anxiety can make you feel self-conscious. Refocus by observing your surroundings, listening carefully, or noticing small details in the room. Shifting attention outward eases inner pressure.

  utter_anxiety/p0049:
    - text: |
        Freezing is a normal reaction to anxiety. Pause, take one deep breath, and give yourself permission to respond at your own pace. This gentle reset helps you regain control.

  utter_anxiety/p0050:
    - text: |
        Disagreements can trigger anxious feelings. Practice calm, assertive communication by using clear “I” statements about your needs. This approach reduces tension while expressing your thoughts.

  utter_anxiety/p0051:
    - text: |
        Social interactions can drain energy. Give yourself time to rest and recharge afterward with a quiet activity you enjoy. Protecting your energy helps maintain balance.

  utter_anxiety/p0052:
    - text: |
        Staying focused in class can be difficult with anxiety. Try sitting near the front, taking hand-written notes, and studying in short bursts with breaks. These habits can improve concentration.

  utter_anxiety/p0053:
    - text: |
        Unexpected calls can trigger nerves. It’s okay to let them go to voicemail and return the call when you feel ready. Setting boundaries around communication is healthy.

  utter_anxiety/p0054:
    - text: |
        Uncertainty can feel uncomfortable. Practice letting go by allowing others to make small decisions, like choosing where to eat. Small steps build tolerance for the unknown.

  utter_anxiety/p0055:
    - text: |
        Relaxation can feel unfamiliar if you’re often anxious. Start with just a few minutes of calm time each day, like listening to gentle music. Gradual practice teaches your mind it’s safe to let go.

  utter_anxiety/p0056:
    - text: |
        Sudden changes can be stressful. Pause, take a deep breath, and give yourself a moment to adjust before responding. This short buffer reduces overwhelm.

  utter_anxiety/p0057:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can block hobbies you enjoy. Set a timer for just five minutes to begin the activity, without pressure to finish. Often, starting is enough to ease the hesitation.

  utter_anxiety/p0058:
    - text: |
        Dwelling on the past can fuel anxiety. Mindfulness—focusing only on the current activity—helps reduce rumination. Practice by giving your full attention to a simple task like washing your hands or eating slowly.

  utter_anxiety/p0059:
    - text: |
        Forgetfulness happens when anxiety overloads your thoughts. Keep checklists and set small reminders to stay on track. Writing tasks down frees your mind from carrying them all at once.

  utter_anxiety/p0060:
    - text: |
        Fear of failure can hold you back. Take on small challenges and remind yourself that effort matters as much as outcome. Each step forward builds resilience and confidence.

  utter_anxiety/p0061:
    - text: |

  utter_anxiety/p0063:
    - text: |
        Planning can feel stressful under anxiety. Start with a flexible schedule of just two or three tasks for the day. Completing them builds momentum without adding pressure.

  utter_anxiety/p0064:
    - text: |
        Meeting new people online can feel intimidating. Prepare a few simple topics or questions in advance to ease the first moments. Planning ahead builds confidence and reduces nerves.

  utter_depression/p0001:
  - text: Feeling empty can be a very lonely experience, and it’s a common part of
      depression. It may help to gently reconnect with your senses—listening to music,
      smelling something pleasant, or holding something soft can ground you in the
      present. These small sensory moments can slowly help you feel more connected,
      even when emotions are hard to find. Please know your feelings matter, even
      when you feel numb.
  utter_depression/p0002:
  - text: Trouble concentrating is something many people experience with depression.
      You might try studying in short bursts and taking frequent breaks to avoid feeling
      overwhelmed. Even if your progress feels slow, every bit of effort is meaningful.
      Give yourself credit for anything you’re able to do today, and know that you’re
      not alone in facing these challenges.
  utter_depression/p0003:
  - text: Feeling worthless is a painful symptom of depression, and it’s not a reflection
      of your true value. Try writing down a few things you’ve accomplished or positive
      qualities others have noticed about you, no matter how small. Reading these
      when you feel low can help you remember that you have worth, even when your
      mind says otherwise.
  utter_depression/p0004:
  - text: Academic struggles are very common when you’re feeling depressed. It can
      help to break assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks and reach out
      to your teachers for support if possible. Remember, your health and well-being
      come first, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
  utter_depression/p0005:
  - text: Losing interest in everything can make life feel dull and exhausting. When
      this happens, try to keep a simple daily routine, even if it’s just waking up,
      eating, and getting dressed. Routines help anchor your days and can gently remind
      you that you’re still moving forward, even when motivation is low.
  utter_depression/p0006:
  - text: Emotional numbness is a common way your mind tries to protect you from pain.
      Even though it feels uncomfortable, this numbness is temporary. Engaging your
      senses with simple experiences, like holding a warm mug or listening to your
      favorite song, can help bring small moments of comfort and connection.
  utter_depression/p0007:
  - text: Opening up about your feelings can be difficult, but you’re not alone in
      this. Sometimes writing down what you want to say beforehand or expressing yourself
      through art or music can help you process and share your emotions. Remember,
      reaching out is a strong and courageous step toward healing.
  utter_depression/p0008:
  - text: These painful thoughts are a symptom of depression, not a reflection of
      reality. Try to recall times when your friends valued your company, or moments
      when you supported them. You are an important part of other people’s lives,
      even when it’s hard to see your own worth. Please remember that your presence
      matters.
  utter_depression/p0009:
  - text: Sleeping a lot during the day is a common sign of depression. Try setting
      gentle alarms to wake up after short naps and spend some time by a window or
      in natural light. Adjusting your sleep routine slowly can help restore your
      energy and support a more balanced mood.
  utter_depression/p0010:
  - text: Depression often makes self-care feel impossible. Breaking tasks into tiny
      steps—like sitting up, moving to the bathroom, or having a small snack—can make
      things more manageable. Celebrate every effort, and remember that your needs
      are important, no matter how small the steps seem.
  utter_depression/p0011:
  - text: Wanting to stay inside is common with depression. Even small actions, like
      opening a window or stepping outside for a minute, can help you gently reconnect
      with the world. Over time, these small steps can bring a sense of renewal and
      comfort.
  utter_depression/p0012:
  - text: Depression can make it feel like you’re standing still. Trying one new,
      small activity each day—like listening to a new song or changing your usual
      routine—can help you notice progress, even if it’s slow. Every small step forward
      matters and shows your resilience.
  utter_depression/p0013:
  - text: Irritability is a real symptom of depression, not a sign that you’re a bad
      person. When you notice yourself becoming upset, pausing for a moment to take
      a few deep breaths can help you regain control. Practicing patience and self-forgiveness
      is important—everyone has hard days.
  utter_depression/p0014:
  - text: Hopelessness can be one of the toughest feelings depression brings. On these
      days, try focusing on just one meaningful or enjoyable activity, no matter how
      small. Even a short walk, a favorite snack, or a simple pleasure can make a
      difference and remind you that your feelings can change.
  utter_depression/p0015:
  - text: Indecisiveness is a common struggle with depression. Try writing down your
      options and considering the pros and cons of each, even for minor decisions.
      This can help make choices feel less overwhelming, and over time, your confidence
      in making decisions can grow.
  utter_depression/p0016:
  - text: Withdrawing from loved ones can be a natural response to depression, but
      it often leads to more isolation. Try sending a short message or just being
      present in the same room with someone you trust. Keeping a small connection
      can help you feel less alone.
  utter_depression/p0017:
  - text: Unexplained aches and pains are common with depression. Gentle stretching,
      a warm shower, or using a heating pad can provide comfort. Taking care of your
      body is an important part of emotional healing as well.
  utter_depression/p0018:
  - text: Losing motivation for schoolwork is understandable when you’re feeling down.
      Focusing on starting with just one small part of a task, instead of the whole,
      can make things less overwhelming and help you regain a sense of accomplishment.
  utter_depression/p0019:
  - text: When small tasks feel huge, try breaking them into single steps and giving
      yourself credit for each accomplishment. Remind yourself that your pace is okay
      and that any progress is a victory.
  utter_depression/p0020:
  - text: Excessive guilt is a painful part of depression. Practicing self-forgiveness
      and remembering that everyone makes mistakes can help ease this burden. Be gentle
      with yourself and recognize that your feelings are not always facts.
  utter_depression/p0021:
  - text: Loss of appetite is common in depression. Try to have small, frequent snacks
      or drinks throughout the day to support your body’s needs. Even eating a little
      is a positive step.
  utter_depression/p0022:
  - text: Emotional eating is a common response to sadness. Try to choose nourishing
      snacks and eat mindfully, noticing how different foods make you feel. Being
      kind to yourself during these moments is just as important as making healthy
      choices.
  utter_depression/p0023:
  - text: Anxiety and sadness often go hand in hand. Practicing slow, deep breathing
      or grounding techniques, like naming things you see or hear around you, can
      help you feel more steady and in control.
  utter_depression/p0024:
  - text: Psychomotor slowing is a real symptom of depression. Try gentle movements,
      like stretching or a short walk, to encourage your body and mind to re-engage.
      Small physical actions can help you feel a little more awake and present.
  utter_depression/p0025:
  - text: It takes a lot of energy to hide your struggles. Giving yourself permission
      to be honest with at least one person you trust, or expressing your feelings
      in a journal, can bring relief and reduce the weight of pretending.
  utter_depression/p0026:
  - text: Feeling stuck and hopeless is a heavy burden. Recovery can take time, but
      it is possible. Celebrate even the smallest improvements, and remind yourself
      that change, no matter how slow, is real and meaningful.
  utter_depression/p0027:
  - text: Emotional isolation is tough, even in a crowd. Gently joining group activities,
      or simply being near others, can help you reconnect over time, even if you don’t
      feel like talking.
  utter_depression/p0028:
  - text: Losing interest quickly is common. Using timers for short work periods with
      breaks can make tasks more manageable. Completing small sections is still real
      progress.
  utter_depression/p0029:
  - text: Negative self-image is a painful part of depression. Try to focus on small
      acts of self-care or write down qualities you appreciate about yourself, even
      if they’re not about appearance. Your value goes beyond looks.
  utter_depression/p0030:
  - text: Physical symptoms can be linked to emotional distress. Relaxation techniques,
      like deep breathing and gentle stretching, may help ease discomfort. Taking
      care of your body supports your mind, too.
  utter_depression/p0031:
  - text: Losing interest in planning is a natural part of depression. Focusing on
      just one day at a time and setting small, achievable goals can help you regain
      a sense of purpose.
  utter_depression/p0032:
  - text: This is a common way people protect themselves during depression. Remind
      yourself that it’s okay to accept support, and reaching out, even a little,
      is an act of courage.
  utter_depression/p0033:
  - text: Frequent tears are a sign of emotional overwhelm. Gentle activities, like
      listening to soothing music or taking a warm bath, can help provide comfort
      when feelings are intense.
  utter_depression/p0034:
  - text: Memory problems can be part of depression. Writing reminders or using notes

      only write a sentence or two each day. Noticing small patterns over time can
      make your feelings feel less heavy and help you see moments of hope, even when
      things are tough. Please remember that what you’re feeling is valid and you
      deserve support.
  utter_depression/p0041:
  - text: You’re not alone in feeling this way. Depression can make it incredibly
      hard to start even simple tasks. Try to be kind to yourself and set just one
      small goal each day, like eating breakfast or making your bed. Each small step

      credit for every effort, and know that motivation can return gradually with
      patience and support.

      recharge. Your efforts, no matter how small, are enough for today.
  utter_depression/p0045:
  - text: It can be so discouraging when nothing seems to bring happiness. Depression
      has a way of numbing our feelings and making good moments hard to notice. One
      gentle way to help is to keep a gratitude journal—just jot down a few small

      coffee. Over time, this practice can help you reconnect with moments of comfort
      or joy, even if they’re brief.
  utter_depression/p0046:

      you that you’re not alone, even if it feels that way sometimes.
  utter_depression/p0047:
  - text: Tears can come unexpectedly when we’re carrying a lot inside. Allowing yourself

      you’re allowed to express them.
  utter_depression/p0048:
  - text: It’s common for depression to make you feel like you’re a burden, but your
      feelings are not a burden and you are important to those who care about you.

      support.

  utter_grief_loss/p0039:
  - text: Moving forward doesn’t mean forgetting. It’s okay to find joy and meaning
      again while still honoring the person you lost. Your loved one would want you
      to heal and be happy.
  utter_grief_loss/p0040:
  - text: Sleep disturbances are common during grief. Practice calming bedtime routines
      and seek support if you’re having trouble sleeping over a long period.
  utter_grief_loss/p0041:
  - text: Life may feel very different after a loss, but over time, you’ll find a
      new sense of normal. Healing happens slowly, and it’s okay to adjust at your
      own pace.
  utter_grief_loss/p0042:
  - text: Loss can change us in many ways. Allow yourself to grow and learn from your
      experience, and seek out new sources of meaning and support as you heal.
  utter_grief_loss/p0043:
  - text: Guilt and regret are natural. Try to focus on the love and care you gave,
      and forgive yourself for being human. Support from others can help you work
      through these feelings.
  utter_grief_loss/p0044:
  - text: There are many ways to honor a loved one—sharing stories, making a scrapbook,
      or doing something they enjoyed. Find a ritual that feels right for you.
  utter_grief_loss/p0045:
  - text: You have the right to share your feelings as often as you need. If you sense
      others are less available, reach out to support groups or counselors who are
      always ready to listen.
  utter_grief_loss/p0046:
  - text: Supporting others is important, but you also need space to grieve. Make
      time for your own healing and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need
      it.
  utter_grief_loss/p0047:
  - text: Strong emotions are a natural part of grief, and you don’t have to hide
      them. If you get emotional in public, take a few deep breaths or step away if
      you need to. Your feelings are nothing to be ashamed of.
  utter_grief_loss/p0048:
  - text: Healing looks different for everyone, and there’s no deadline. Keep reaching
      out for support, and allow yourself to heal at your own pace. You are not alone
      in your journey.
